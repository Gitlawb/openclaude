# Codebase Intelligence — Repo Map

The repo map feature gives the AI model structural awareness of your codebase at the start of each session. Instead of the model needing to explore the repository with `Grep`, `Glob`, and `Read` calls, it starts with a ranked summary of the most important files and their key signatures.

## How it works

1. **File enumeration** — Lists all tracked files via `git ls-files` (falls back to a manual directory walk when not in a git repo)
2. **Symbol extraction** — Parses each supported source file with tree-sitter to extract function, class, type, and interface definitions, plus cross-file references
3. **Reference graph** — Builds a directed graph where an edge from file A to file B means A references a symbol defined in B. Edges are weighted by reference count multiplied by the IDF (inverse document frequency) of the symbol name — common names like `get`, `set`, `value` contribute less
4. **PageRank** — Ranks files by structural importance using PageRank. Files imported by many others rank highest
5. **Rendering** — Walks ranked files top-down, emitting file paths and definition signatures, stopping when the token budget is reached

Results are cached to disk (`~/.openclaude/repomap-cache/`) keyed by file path, mtime, and size. Only changed files are re-parsed on subsequent runs.

## Supported languages

- TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`)
- JavaScript (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`)
- Python (`.py`)

Additional language grammars will be added in future releases.

## Enabling auto-injection

The repo map is gated behind the `REPO_MAP` feature flag, **off by default**. To enable auto-injection into the session context:

Set the environment variable before launching:

```bash
REPO_MAP=1 openclaude
```

Or add it to your shell profile for persistent use.

When enabled, the map is built once per session and prepended to the system context alongside git status and CLAUDE.md content. The default budget is 1024 tokens.

Auto-injection is skipped in:
- Bare mode (`--bare`)
- Remote sessions (`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`)

## The /repomap slash command

The `/repomap` command is always available regardless of the feature flag. It lets you inspect and tune the map interactively.

```
/repomap                          # Show the map with default settings (1024 tokens)
/repomap --tokens 4096            # Increase the token budget for a larger map
/repomap --focus src/tools/       # Boost specific paths in the ranking
/repomap --focus src/context.ts   # Can use multiple --focus flags
/repomap --stats                  # Show cache statistics
/repomap --invalidate             # Clear cache and rebuild from scratch
```

## The RepoMap tool

The model can also call the `RepoMap` tool on demand during a session. This is useful when:
- The model needs structural context mid-conversation
- The user asks about specific areas (the model can pass `focus_files` or `focus_symbols`)
- A larger token budget is needed than the auto-injected default

## Known limitations

- **Signatures only** — The map shows function/class/type declarations, not implementations. The model still needs `Read` to see function bodies.
- **Cold build time** — First build on large repos (2000+ files) can take 20-30 seconds due to WASM-based parsing. Subsequent builds use the disk cache and complete in under 100ms.
- **Language coverage** — Only TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python are supported. Files in other languages are skipped.
- **TypeScript references** — The TypeScript tree-sitter query captures type annotations and `new` expressions as references, but not plain function calls. This means the ranking slightly favors type-heavy hub files.
- **Git dependency** — File enumeration uses `git ls-files` by default. Non-git repos fall back to a directory walk with hardcoded exclusions.
