# OpenClaude

OpenClaude is an open-source coding-agent CLI for cloud and local model providers.

Use OpenAI-compatible APIs, Gemini, GitHub Models, Codex OAuth, Codex, Ollama, Atomic Chat, and other supported backends while keeping one terminal-first workflow: prompts, tools, agents, MCP, slash commands, and streaming output.

## Star History

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/chart?repos=gitlawb/openclaude&type=date&legend=top-left)](https://www.star-history.com/?repos=gitlawb%2Fopenclaude&type=date&legend=top-left)

## Why OpenClaude

- Use one CLI across cloud APIs and local model backends
- Save provider profiles inside the app with `/provider`
- Run with OpenAI-compatible services, Gemini, GitHub Models, Codex OAuth, Codex, Ollama, Atomic Chat, and other supported providers
- Keep coding-agent workflows in one place: bash, file tools, grep, glob, agents, tasks, MCP, and web tools
- Use the bundled VS Code extension for launch integration and theme support

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @gitlawb/openclaude@latest
```

If you're on Arch Linux, you can install OpenClaude from the community-maintained [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openclaude):
```bash
paru -S openclaude
```

If the install later reports `ripgrep not found`, install ripgrep system-wide and confirm `rg --version` works in the same terminal before starting OpenClaude.

**Verify / troubleshoot installed version:**

```bash
openclaude --version
npm view @gitlawb/openclaude dist-tags
npm install -g @gitlawb/openclaude@latest
```

### Start

```bash
openclaude
```

Inside OpenClaude:

- run `/provider` for guided provider setup and saved profiles
- run `/onboard-github` for GitHub Models onboarding

### Fastest OpenAI setup

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

openclaude
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI="1"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"

openclaude
```

### Fastest local Ollama setup

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENAI_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:7b

openclaude
```

Windows PowerShell:

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Setup Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible | `/provider` or env vars | Works with OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, LM Studio, and other compatible `/v1` servers |
| Hicap | `/provider` or OpenAI-compatible env vars | Uses `api-key` auth, discovers models from unauthenticated `/models`, and supports Responses mode for `gpt-` models |
| Fireworks AI | `/provider` or env vars | First-class provider with 276 curated models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama, Gemma, and more); uses `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` |
| Gemini | `/provider` or env vars | Supports API key only |
| GitHub Models | `/onboard-github` | Interactive onboarding with saved credentials |
| Codex OAuth | `/provider` | Opens ChatGPT sign-in in your browser and stores Codex credentials securely |
| Codex | `/provider` | Uses existing Codex CLI auth, OpenClaude secure storage, or env credentials |
| Gitlawb Opengateway | Startup default, `/provider`, or env vars | Smart gateway at `https://opengateway.gitlawb.com/v1`; requires an API key from https://gitlawb.com/opengateway/keys and routes Xiaomi MiMo and GMI Cloud partner models by `OPENAI_MODEL` |
| OpenCode Zen | `/provider` or env vars | Pay-as-you-go AI gateway (43 models); uses `OPENCODE_API_KEY` via `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`; shared key with OpenCode Go |
| OpenCode Go | `/provider` or env vars | $10/mo subscription for open models (13 models); uses `OPENCODE_API_KEY` via `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`; shared key with OpenCode Zen |
| Xiaomi MiMo | `/provider` or env vars | OpenAI-compatible API at `https://mimo.mi.com`; uses `MIMO_API_KEY` and defaults to `mimo-v2.5-pro` |
| NEAR AI | `/provider` or env vars | Unified gateway (Claude, GPT, Gemini + TEE open models); uses `NEARAI_API_KEY` at `https://cloud-api.near.ai/v1` |
| Ollama | `/provider` or env vars | Local inference with no API key |
| Atomic Chat | `/provider`, env vars, or `bun run dev:atomic-chat` | Local Model Provider; auto-detects loaded models |
| Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry | env vars | Anthropic-family cloud routes; Vertex is for Claude on Vertex AI, not arbitrary Model Garden models |

## What Works

- **Tool-driven coding workflows**: Bash, file read/write/edit, grep, glob, agents, tasks, MCP, and slash commands
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time token output and tool progress
- **Tool calling**: Multi-step tool loops with model calls, tool execution, and follow-up responses
- **Images**: URL and base64 image inputs for providers that support vision
- **Provider profiles**: Guided setup plus saved user-level provider profile support
- **Local and remote model backends**: Cloud APIs, local servers, and Apple Silicon local inference

## Provider Notes

OpenClaude supports multiple providers, but behavior is not identical across all of them.

- Anthropic-specific features may not exist on other providers
- Tool quality depends heavily on the selected model
- Smaller local models can struggle with long multi-step tool flows
- Some providers impose lower output caps than the CLI defaults, and OpenClaude adapts where possible
- Gitlawb Opengateway is the fresh-install startup default and requires an API key from https://gitlawb.com/opengateway/keys. It uses one OpenAI-compatible base URL; switch between `mimo-*` and `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` with `/model`, and do not pin the base URL to `/v1/xiaomi-mimo`.
- Xiaomi MiMo uses `api-key` header auth on the direct OpenAI-compatible route and currently does not support `/usage` reporting in OpenClaude

For best results, use models with strong tool/function calling support.

## Agent Routing

OpenClaude can route different agents to different models through settings-based routing. This is useful for cost optimization or splitting work by model strength.

Add to `~/.openclaude.json`:

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "deepseek-v4-flash": {
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    },
    "zai-default": {
      "model": "glm-5.1",
      "base_url": "https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    },
    "gpt-4o": {
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    }
  },
  "agentRouting": {
    "Explore": "deepseek-v4-flash",
    "Plan": "gpt-4o",
    "general-purpose": "gpt-4o",
    "frontend-dev": "zai-default",
    "default": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

When no routing match is found, the global provider remains the fallback.

`agentRouting` values and explicit Agent tool `model` overrides match keys in `agentModels`. By default, that key is also the model string sent to the provider. Set `agentModels.<key>.model` when you want a local route key such as `zai-default` to call a different provider model name such as `glm-5.1`.

> **Note:** `/provider` changes the global/parent provider for your current session. `agentModels` and `agentRouting` are specifically for configuring per-agent provider overrides while keeping the parent session unchanged.

> **Note:** `api_key` values in `settings.json` are stored in plaintext. Keep this file private and do not commit it to version control.

**Model-only routes (same provider):** Omit `base_url` and `api_key` to run an agent on a different model using your *current* provider's endpoint and key — no credential duplication:

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "mini": { "model": "gpt-5-mini" }
  },
  "agentRouting": {
    "verification": "mini"
  }
}
```

**Built-in agents are routable by their type name.** Useful keys: `verification` (the read-only auditor that runs before completion), `Explore`, and `Plan`. For example, `"agentRouting": { "verification": "mini" }` runs the verifier on `gpt-5-mini` while your main session stays on its model. Absent any entry, the verifier inherits the main-loop model.

## Web Search and Fetch

By default, `WebSearch` works on non-Anthropic models using DuckDuckGo. This gives GPT-4o, DeepSeek, Gemini, Ollama, and other OpenAI-compatible providers a free web search path out of the box.

> **Note:** DuckDuckGo fallback works by scraping search results and may be rate-limited, blocked, or subject to DuckDuckGo's Terms of Service. If you want a more reliable supported option, configure Firecrawl.

For Anthropic-native backends and Codex responses, OpenClaude keeps the native provider web search behavior.

`WebFetch` works, but its basic HTTP plus HTML-to-markdown path can still fail on JavaScript-rendered sites or sites that block plain HTTP requests.

Set a [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) API key if you want Firecrawl-powered search/fetch behavior:

```bash
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

With Firecrawl enabled:

- `WebSearch` can use Firecrawl's search API while DuckDuckGo remains the default free path for non-Claude models
- `WebFetch` uses Firecrawl's scrape endpoint instead of raw HTTP, handling JS-rendered pages correctly

Free tier at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) includes 500 credits. The key is optional.

## Headless gRPC Server

OpenClaude can be run as a headless gRPC service, allowing you to integrate its agentic capabilities (tools, bash, file editing) into other applications, CI/CD pipelines, or custom user interfaces. The server uses bidirectional streaming to send real-time text chunks, tool calls, and request permissions for sensitive commands.

### 1. Start the gRPC Server

Start the core engine as a gRPC service on `localhost:50051`:

```bash
npm run dev:grpc
```

#### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `GRPC_PORT` | `50051` | Port the gRPC server listens on |
| `GRPC_HOST` | `localhost` | Bind address. Use `0.0.0.0` to expose on all interfaces (not recommended without authentication) |

### 2. Run the Test CLI Client

We provide a lightweight CLI client that communicates exclusively over gRPC. It acts just like the main interactive CLI, rendering colors, streaming tokens, and prompting you for tool permissions (y/n) via the gRPC `action_required` event.

In a separate terminal, run:

```bash
npm run dev:grpc:cli
```

*Note: The gRPC definitions are located in `src/proto/openclaude.proto`. You can use this file to generate clients in Python, Go, Rust, or any other language.*

## Source Build And Local Development

```bash
bun install
bun run build
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Helpful commands:

- `bun run dev`
- `bun test`
- `bun run test:coverage`
- `bun run security:pr-scan -- --base origin/main`
- `bun run smoke`
- `bun run doctor:runtime`
- `bun run verify:privacy`
- focused `bun test ...` runs for the areas you touch

## Testing And Coverage

OpenClaude uses Bun's built-in test runner for unit tests.

Run the full unit suite:

```bash
bun test
```

Generate unit test coverage:

```bash
bun run test:coverage
```

Open the visual coverage report:

```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

If you already have `coverage/lcov.info` and only want to rebuild the UI:

```bash
bun run test:coverage:ui
```

Use focused test runs when you only touch one area:

- `bun run test:provider`
- `bun run test:provider-recommendation`
- `bun test path/to/file.test.ts`

Recommended contributor validation before opening a PR:

- `bun run build`
- `bun run smoke`
- `bun run test:coverage` for broader unit coverage when your change affects shared runtime or provider logic
- focused `bun test ...` runs for the files and flows you changed

Coverage output is written to `coverage/lcov.info`, and OpenClaude also generates a git-activity-style heatmap at `coverage/index.html`.
